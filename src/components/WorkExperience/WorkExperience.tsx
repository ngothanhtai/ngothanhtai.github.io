              After leaving Skoolbo, mobile apps are getting popular. I joined
              an iOS Swift class at Coderschool, where I learned to build a
              complete iOS app with a 3-person team. The class took me 3 months
              to learn and do the final project. Coderschool has a demo day at
              the end of the class. We are the winner of that demo day.
            </li>
            <li>
              An audience at the demo day contacted me for his project. After
              that, I joined his project as a co-founder where I took
              responsibility to build mobile apps for iOS, find a person to
              build an Android app and a friend to handle the backend. From the
              technical side, we did finish the basic functionality, we launched
              the app and let our team, CEO, and operation team to validate the
              idea. It does not go well so we decided to stop working on this
              project. One year for my first start-up.
