          I'm a software engineer based in Vietnam with eight years of

          I have worked as a Flash Game Developer for three years and Unity 3D
          for one year. Then I changed to become a mobile developer, where I
          used Swift to build an iOS app for one year, then use React Native for
          three years. I also use React to build websites for one year. I have
          been using Flutter for nearly one year to build two side projects.
        </p>

        <p className="body">
          I am a product person because I prefer focusing on building the user
          interface, user experience, an eye on detail, and features than
          spending time on doing on tech debts. I mostly follow my tech lead's
          guide.
        </p>

        <p className="body">
          I have always considered that I am hardworking and patient, interested
          in learning new technologies and try to do things in more efficient
          ways.

          I am looking to work for a front-end job that will use React / React
          Native / Flutter or SwiftUI.
